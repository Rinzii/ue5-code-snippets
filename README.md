# ue5-code-snippets
This is a collection of code snippets I have produced for the various game jams/projects I have participated in.

This repository is more so for me to store code that may be useful to me later down the line so I don't have to hunt through my various project files just to find past implementations I've done. As such many of these snippets will not work without some modification from the end user. 

Also these snippets have been produced over the time I've been learning the in and outs of Unreal engine and as such many code snippets will not be using best practices or may not be indicitive of my current skill set as they may of been made much earlier than other snippets.

If you notice something wrong in a code snippet of mine feel free to let me know!  :)
